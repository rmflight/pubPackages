# pubPackages

Which CRAN and Bioconductor packages have an associated publication?

Are there any publications that report a package and are not on CRAN or Bioconductor?

Lets find out.

Plan of attack is:

Get full list of packages on CRAN & Bioconductor

Do a Pubmed search for R package in the title and abstract text

Cross reference the package names with words in the title and abstract results.

For those abstracts without corresponding published package names, check for URLs that may harbor packages that are hosted at a personal or institutional site.
